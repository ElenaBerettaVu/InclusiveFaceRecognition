# The invisible society: Misgendering in Facial Recognition System 

## About the Project
**The invisible society: Misgendering in Facial Recognition System**__ project is an open-source initiative aimed at addressing the challenges and concerns in building inclusive facial recognition systems. Our goal is to foster critical analysis and discussions on the relationships among gender, identity, and face recognition technologies. We aim to encourage interdisciplinary dialogue to develop inclusive, diverse, and trustworthy AI systems, highlighting the dichotomy between self-perceived gender and machine-classified gender.

## Key Features
**Survey Module**: Engage in surveys about identity, identification, misidentification, and disidentification.
**Participatory AI**: Contribute to the development and refinement of AI models.
**Open Dataset**: Access and contribute to a dataset based on survey responses.
**Community Collaboration**: Participate in discussions and propose new survey questions or topics.
**Artistic Collaborations**: Explore the intersection of art and technology in understanding gender and identity.
